    <p>
        The swimmer&#39;s legal first name, middle name, last name and birthday are not
        available to be edited because they are used to determine the swimmer&#39;s USA
        Swimming Identification number. If these values are changed, it would cause the
        USA Swimming number to be changed.</p>
    <p>
        If you need to edit this information, you must contact Chris Pierson directly at
        <a href="mailto:cpierson@sev.org">cpierson@sev.org</a> because there is a special
        process that has to be gone through with Ohio Swimming Inc. in order to create a
        new USA Swimming ID Number.</p>
