            <span new="" style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;" times="">At the
                end of the short course season, there was a bevy of LSC records set, 21 to be exact.
                This year was a bit of a contrast to last year in that this year there were a ton
                of records broken right at the end of the season and last year there was a steady
                stream of them coming in all year with no real big spike at any time.<br />
                <br />
                We will begin with the records broken at the Ohio Short Course Junior Olympics.</span></span></p>
    <ul new="" style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;" times="">
        <li><b>Carson Foster</b> (CM) swam a 27.60 in the 10 &amp; Under 50 fly, breaking the
            previous record of 28.35 set by Matthew Abysinghe (DR) in Feb. 2007.</li>
        <li><b>Kelsey Morgan</b> (DST) broke records in the 11-12 Girls 100 &amp; 200 Breast,
            swimming a 1:05.71 and 2:20.00 respectively. The previous records were a 1:06.29
            and 2:23.82, both set by Alison Fealey (CM) in March 1991. <em>(Kelsey broke the 200
                breast record at the Ohio Senior Meet.)</em></li>
        <li>It was <b>Miranda Donley</b> (NAAC) breaking records in the 11-12 Girls 50 Free
            &amp; 50 Fly, setting marks of 24.28 and 25.77 respectively. The previous 50 free
            record was from Zhada Fields (GTAC) at a 24.40, set July 2010. The previous 50 fly
            record was 25.79 set by Rachel Jackson (NAAC) in March 2008.</li>
        <li>In the 11-12 Girls 400 Medley Relay a new record of 4:06.54 set by the Northern
            Kentucky Clippers Relay of <b>Sophie Skinner</b>, <b>Sarah Harkrader</b>, <b>Samantha
                Glass</b>, and <b>Mallory Beil</b>, which broke the previous record of 4:06.92
            set by the Cincinnati Pepsi Marlins all the way back in December 1979 (which was
            the national record until 1992.)</li>
        <li>The Northern Kentucky Clippers relay of <strong>Michael Summe</strong>, <strong>
            Jacob Lentsch</strong>, <strong>Austin Haney</strong>, and <strong>Robert Newman</strong>
            swam a 3:19.89 in the 400 Free Relay, which broke the old record of 3:19.91 set
            by the Cincinnati Pepsi Marlins in March 1978.</li>
    </ul>
    <p new="" style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;" times="">
        Next come records set at the Sectional Championships. All of these are LONG COURSE
        records.</p>
    <ul new="" style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;" times="">
        <li>It was 12 year old <strong>Kelsey Morgan</strong> (DST) swimming a 2:40.63 in the

            record of 1:02.52 set by Betsy Mitchell (CPM) all the way back in July 1984.</li>
        <li>It was <strong>Max Williamson</strong> (CLPR) swimming 2:16.54 in the 200 Breast
            and 2:02.96 in the 200 IM to break 17-18 and overall Open records in both events.
            The previous 17-18 200 IM Record was 2:05.77 set by Nate Dusing (CM) in July 1997
            and the previous Open IM record was 2:03.24 set by B. Frentos in August 1980. The
            previous 17-18 and Open 200 breast records were 2:18.03 set by the legendary Glenn
            Mills in July 1980. After 32 years, this swim removes Mills&#39; name entirely from

            books.</li>
        <li>At the YMCA National Championship meet, <strong>Joshua Fleagle</strong> swam a 43.41
            in the 100 Free. This broke the previous 17-18 record of 43.43 set by Joe Hudepohl
