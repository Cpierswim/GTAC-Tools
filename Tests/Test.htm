            Record Rundown</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;</span><span
                style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: x-small;">- Tuesday, April 10,
                2012</span><br style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" />
        <br style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" />
        <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;">At the end of the short
            course season, there was a bevy of LSC records set, 20 to be exact. This year was
            a bit of a contrast to last year in that this year there were a ton of records broken
            right at the end of the season and last year there was a steady stream of them coming
            in all year with no real big spike at any time.<br />
            <br />
            We will begin with the records broken at the Ohio Short Course Junior Olympics.
        </span>
    </p>
    <ul style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;">
        <li><b>Carson Foster</b> (CM) swam a 27.60 in the 10 & Under 50 fly, breaking the previous
            record of 28.35 set by Matthew Abysinghe (DR) in Feb. 2007. </li>
        <li><b>Kelsey Morgan</b> (DST) broke records in the 11-12 Girls 100 & 200 Breast, swimming
            a 1:05.71 and 2:20.00 respectively. The previous records were a 1:06.29 and 2:23.82,
            both set by Alison Fealey (CM) in March 1991. <em>(Kelsey broke the 200 breast record
            at the Ohio Senior Meet.)</em></li>
        <li>It was <b>Miranda Donley</b> (NAAC) breaking records in the 11-12 Girls 50 Free
            & 50 Fly, setting marks of 24.28 and 25.77 respectively. The previous 50 free record
            was from Zhada Fields (GTAC) at a 24.40, set July 2010. The previous 50 fly record
            was 25.79 set by Rachel Jackson (NAAC) in March 2008. </li>
        <li>In the 11-12 Girls 400 Medley Relay a new record of 4:06.54 set by the Northern
            Kentucky Clippers Relay of <b>Sophie Skinner</b>, <b>Sarah Harkrader</b>, <b>Samantha
                Glass</b>, and <b>Mallory Beil</b>, which broke the previous record of 4:06.92
            set by the Cincinnati Pepsi Marlins all the way back in December 1979 (which was
            the national record until 1992.)</li>
        <li>The Northern Kentucky Clippers relay of <strong>Michael Summe</strong>, <strong>
            Jacob Lentsch</strong>, <strong>Austin Haney</strong>, and <strong>Robert Newman</strong>
            swam a 3:19.89 in the 400 Free Relay, which broke the old record of 3:34.89 set
            by the Dayon Raiders in March 2009.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;">
        Next come records set at the Sectional Championships. All of these are LONG 
        COURSE records.</p>
    <ul style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;">
        <li>It was 12 year old <strong>Kelsey Morgan</strong> (DST) swimming a 2:40.63 in 
            the 200 Breast, crushing her own 11-12 record of 2:48.34 from June of last year.</li>
        <li>In the 13-14 girls 100 Back, <strong>Hannah Whiteley</strong> (RAYS) swam a 
            1:04.45, breaking the 1:04.97 of Emily Slabe (CFY) from July 2010.</li>
        <li><strong>Zoe Thatcher</strong> (RAYS) swam an 800 Free in 8:55.49, which broke 
            the 15-16 record of 8:55.92 set by Margy Keefe (AB) in August 2001.</li>
        <li><strong>Caitlyn Forman</strong> (CLPR) swam a 1:02.44 100 back, breaking the 
            17-18 record of 1:02.52 set by Betsy Mitchell (CPM) all the way back in July 
            1984.</li>
        <li>It was <strong>Max Williamson</strong> (CLPR) swimming 2:16.54 in the 200 Breast 
            and 2:02.96 in the 200 IM to break 17-18 and overall Open records in both 
            events. The previous 17-18 200 IM Record was 2:05.77 set by Nate Dusing (CM) in 
            July 1997 and the previous Open IM record was 2:03.24 set by B. Frentos in 
            August 1980. The previous 17-18 and Open 200 breast records were 2:18.03 set by 
            the legendary Glenn Mills in July 1980. After 32 years, this swim removes Mills&#39; 
            name entirely from the Ohio record list.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Swimming at the NSCA Junior Nationals, <strong>Max Williamson</strong> (CLPR) swam

            Final Long Course LSC Records - Updated</span> <span style="font-size: x-small;">- Friday,
                August 19, 2011</span><br />
            <br />
            <span style="font-size: small;">8 more LSC Records were set at the final meet of the
                Long Course season. This concludes a season where there were an uncommonly large
                number of records set throughout the season instead of just 1 or 2 meets.<br />
                <br />
                At the USA National Championships <strong>Max Williamson</strong> (CLPR) swam a
                400 IM in 4:23.05 which breaks both the 15-16 record of 4:28.40 set by Kevin Nead
                (ABLY) in July 2002, and the overall LSC record of 4:23.26 set by J. Frentos (CPM)
                in June 1984.<br />
                <br />
                At the Central Zone Championships, 13 year old <strong>Cooper Hodge</strong> (CAC)
                broke 2 LSC records while at the bottom of the age group. In the 100 Breast Cooper
                swam a 1:09.20. This edged out the 1:09.27 of Garth Fealy (CM) in July 1995. He
                also tied the 200 IM record of 2:13.59, previously set last August by Patrick Mulcare
                (DR).<br />
                <br />
                Also at the Central Zone Championships <strong>Greg Kalin</strong> (MHSW) swam a
                29.03 in his 50 free, and a 1:04.23 both of which broke his previous records set
                3 weeks prior at the Ohio Long Course JO meet.<br />
                <br />
                Also at the USA Junior National Championships 15 year old <strong>Patrick Mulcare</strong>
                (DR) set 2 new LSC records for 15-16 boys. His time of 2:05.25 in the 200 IM and
                4:26.30 in the 400 IM broke the previous records of 2:05.67 (Max Williamson, CLPR,
                just last month) and 4:28.40 (Kevin Nead, ABLY, July 2002) respectively.<br />
                <br />
                Also at the Junior National Championships <strong>Cliff Goertemiller</strong> (DR)
                swam a 1500 free in 15:44.69, breaking the previous record of 15:51.12 set in August
                2005 by David Mosko (CM).</span></span></p>

            <br />
            <span style="font-size: small;">The 2011 FINA World Swimming Championships started this
                weekend in Shanghai, China. You can watch coverage of the meet this Saturday and
                Sunday on NBC from 1-3 pm.<br />
                <br />
                3 Current and former Ohio Swimmers are at the meet.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Nick Thoman</strong> and <strong>David Plummer</strong> (both formerly CAC)
                swam the 100 back. (meaning the entire men&#39;s 100 back team was all from Ohio.)
                Nick finished 4th and David finished 5th.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Elliot Keefer</strong> (OSSC) will be swimming the 200 breast.<br />

            Many LSC records at JO Champs</span> <span style="font-size: x-small;">- Friday, July
                22, 2011</span><br />
            <br />
            <span style="font-size: small;">In a season where there were many LSC record being set
                mid-season, it makes sense that there were many LSC Records broken at the Long Course
                JO Championships last weekend.<br />
                <br />
                In the 13-14 Girls 200 Free, <strong>Cara Norris</strong> (CM) swam a 2:04.78. This
                broke one of the older records on the books: the 2:05.38 of Karen Gallagher (CPM)
                from all the way back in August of 1979!<br />
                <br />
                In the 13-14 Girls 200 Back, <strong>Abby Stone</strong> (OSSC) swam a 2:19.95,
                which beat the 2:20.44 set by Jenny Forster (WTRC) in July, 2002.<br />
                <br />
                In the 11-12 Girls 50 Free, <strong>Ashley Volpenhein</strong> (RAYS) swam a 27.68,
                edging out the 27.79 of Kelly Jones (KEY) from August, 1995.<br />
                <br />
                In the 10 &amp; Under boys events <strong>Greg Kalin</strong> (MHSW) broke several
