# GTAC-Tools

The non-CMS portion of the Greater Toledo Aquatic Club website. This was a major project that I undertook when the team's previous website provider went out of business and the competitor was multiple orders of magnitude more expensive. I taught myself ASP.NET in order to have a website that would replace all the features that we were using on the previous commercial site. 

All Features

Account
 - Change password
 - Create website account (with hashed and salted password)
 - Lost password handler
 - Create new account with the team (would send me a text on account creation)
 - Special page to create administrative accounts with different types of privileges


Team Administrator
 - Create and assign swimmers to training groups
 - Team setup page (global variables)
 - Team members view list
 - Contact file creator for integration with Google Contacts (so I would always know who was calling)
 - Set up a list of schools for autocomplete option when parents sign up (for marketing)

Coach
 - Attendance tracker which combined results from kids officially signed up, as well as kids that showed up on a trial basis so their attendance would automatically import when they did sign up (this feature is not available anywhere else commercially currently)
 - Ability to email group
 - Meet event picking without having to have a different page for each swimmer (this feature is not available anywhere else commercially currently)

Carpool Map
 - Used the Google Maps API to filter members by group so members could set up car pools and would suggest carpools (this feature is not available anywhere else commercially currently)

Other details
 - 3 tiered data structure 
 - Was able to use and create files that were used by the desktop software that had a 99% market share at the time, especially important for use with Meet Management software

Parent
 - Calendar for all registered children
