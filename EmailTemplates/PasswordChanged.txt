Your account on the GTAC Tools Website has been changed.<br />
<br />
Your password has been changed.<br />
<br />
Username: <%Username%><br />
Password: <%Password%><br />
<br />
I suggest you copy and paste the password above to the GTAC Login page:
 <a href="http://tools.gtacswim.info/tools/Account/Login.aspx">http://tools.gtacswim.info/tools/Account/Login.aspx</a> Make
 sure that you DO NOT COPY ANY SPACES before or after the password. I've been getting a lot
 of complaints from people complaining that the new password doesn't work, but each case it has been
 people not copying the password correctly.<br />
 <br />
Once you login, you can change your password by clicking on your username in the upper
right hand corner of the page<br />
